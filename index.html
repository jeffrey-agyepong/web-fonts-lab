        “If wishes were horses”
      </h2>
      <p>
        If wishes were horses
        Beggars would ride:
        If turnips were watches
        I would wear one by my side.
        And if if’s and an’s were pots and pans,
        The tinker would never work!</p>

      <h2>“It’s Raining, It’s Pouring”</h2>
      <p>It’s raining; it’s pouring.
        The old man is snoring.
        He bumped his head on the top of the bed,
        And couldn’t get up in the morning.</p>

      <h2>“Itsy Bitsy Spider” </h2>
      <p>
        “The itsy bitsy spider crawled up the water spout.
        Down came the rain, and washed the spider out.
        Out came the sun, and dried up all the rain,
        and the itsy bitsy spider went up the spout again”</p>

      <h2>“Jack and Jill”</h2>
      <p>
        Jack and Jill went up the hill
        To fetch a pail of water.
        Jack fell down and broke his crown,
        And Jill came tumbling after.
        Then up got Jack and said to Jill,
        As in his arms he took her,
        “Brush off that dirt for you’re not hurt,
        Let’s fetch that pail of water.”
        So Jack and Jill went up the hill
        To fetch the pail of water,
        And took it home to Mother dear,
        Who thanked her son and daughter.</p>
